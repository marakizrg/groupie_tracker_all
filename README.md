## ðŸ’» How It Works

###  Step 1: Fetching Artist Data
The app connects to a magical **API** ðŸª„ to retrieve detailed artist info, locations, dates, and relations.

###  Step 2: Dynamic Rendering
- The `index.html` page dynamically displays the artist gallery.
- Clicking on an artist leads to the `artist.html` page, showcasing their details.

###  Step 3: API Endpoints
- `/artists` - Fetches a list of artists.
- `/locations/<id>` - Retrieves concert locations for an artist.
- `/dates/<id>` - Retrieves concert dates.
- `/relation/<id>` - Shows relationships between dates and locations.
